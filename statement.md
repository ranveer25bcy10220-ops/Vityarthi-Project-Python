## Project Statement: Train Ticket Booking System

 This project is all about creating a simple Python program that lets someone book train tickets right from their computer’s terminal. It’s designed to be straightforward and interactive, so users can enter their details, pick their train and travel class, and get a ticket complete with seat info and a unique PNR number.

## Scope of the project

The main goal here is to build a useful and easy-to-use ticket booking system that covers the basics you’d expect from real railway software:

- Get user inputs like name, age, gender, departure and arrival stations.
- Offer seat booking options across AC, Sleeper, and Unreserved classes.
- Assign berths and coach numbers randomly, just like in real life.
- Calculate fares according to the class chosen.
- Create a unique PNR number each time someone books.
- Show all the ticket details clearly so users can double-check.

## Target  users

While it’s a simple console application, it’s target user are :

- Everyday travelers just looking for a simple way to book their seats easily.
- Students and working folks who need to plan their trips ahead without too much fuss.
- Beginners in programming who want a hands-on project to understand how booking software works.
- Small travel agents or entrepreneurs who want a basic system they can build upon.
- Teachers and learners using it as a friendly example to explore programming concepts.

## Features

- Simple, clear command-line prompts that won’t confuse anyone.
- Checks to make sure inputs make sense before proceeding.
- Random and fair berth and coach allocation.
- Correct fare calculation based on your travel class.
- A neatly printed ticket with all your booking info.
- A codebase that’s laid out so you can easily add more cool stuff later.

This statement sums up what this little project is all about. It’s straightforward, practical, and perfect for learning or showing off a neat Python program.
